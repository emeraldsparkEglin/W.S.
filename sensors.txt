🟢 PIR Motion Sensor (Passive Infrared Sensor)
📘 What It Does:
Detects motion by sensing changes in infrared (IR) radiation emitted by warm objects (like humans or animals).


Commonly used in security systems, automatic lights, and room occupancy detection.


⚙️ How It Works:
Contains two IR sensors side by side.


When a warm body moves across its view, it triggers a change in IR levels between the two sensors.


Sends a digital HIGH signal (1) when motion is detected, and LOW (0) otherwise.


🧪 Typical Arduino Connection:
VCC → 5V


GND → GND


OUT → Digital Pin (e.g., D2)


📏 Range:
Distance: ~3–7 meters


Angle: ~120° detection cone


💡 Code Snippet:
cpp
CopyEdit
int pirPin = 2;
int ledPin = 13;

void setup() {
  pinMode(pirPin, INPUT);
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  if (digitalRead(pirPin) == HIGH) {
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  } else {
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  }
}


🔵 Ultrasonic Sensor (e.g., HC-SR04)
📘 What It Does:
Measures distance by sending out ultrasonic waves and timing how long it takes for the echo to return.


Common in obstacle detection, robotics, and automatic parking sensors.


⚙️ How It Works:
Has two main parts:


Trigger: sends a short ultrasonic pulse (usually 40kHz)


Echo: listens for the returning sound wave


The time between sending and receiving is used to calculate distance.


🧪 Typical Arduino Connection:
VCC → 5V


GND → GND


TRIG → Digital Pin (e.g., D9)


ECHO → Digital Pin (e.g., D10)


📏 Range:
Distance: ~2 cm to 400 cm


Accuracy: ±3 mm


Cone angle: ~15°


💡 Code Snippet:
cpp
CopyEdit
const int trigPin = 9;
const int echoPin = 10;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(trigPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(echoPin, INPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
  delayMicroseconds(2);
  digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH);
  delayMicroseconds(10);
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);

  long duration = pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH);
  float distance = duration * 0.034 / 2;  // in cm

  Serial.print("Distance: ");
  Serial.print(distance);
  Serial.println(" cm");
  delay(500);
}

Microwave Motion Sensor (e.g., RCWL-0516)
🔍 Key Features:
Uses Doppler radar (microwave signals) to detect motion


Can see through materials like plastic, wood, thin walls, cardboard — unlike PIR


Much more sensitive and has a wider range, especially for micro-movements


Still outputs a digital HIGH/LOW, like PIR — so code-compatible



⚙️ Typical Specs:
Range: ~5–7 meters


Field of detection: 360° (no lens required)


Voltage: 4–28V


Output: Digital HIGH for ~2s when motion is detected



🧪 Arduino Wiring:
RCWL-0516 Pin
Arduino
VIN
5V
GND
GND
OUT
D2 (or any digital pin)


💡 Sample Code (same as PIR):
cpp
CopyEdit
int motionPin = 2;
int ledPin = 13;

void setup() {
  pinMode(motionPin, INPUT);
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  if (digitalRead(motionPin) == HIGH) {
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  } else {
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  }
}


⚠️ Watch Out For:
It can detect through walls, so it might pick up movement in adjacent rooms — sometimes a downside
